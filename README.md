# Proposal-Republic

Republic is a company that uses crowdsourcing to collect money from numerous individuals for start-ups early stage funding, including cryptocurrency creators. What makes Republic unique is that they allow for investments as low as a couple hundred dollars.

Their primary competitors include Pynk, Amazon, Olapic, PassionAnt and Local Motors. Considering their business model, they're unique in the sense that they use the small amounts of money to provide for start-ups. 

## Republic's Technologies 

*They use mysql ,cloud technology, cryptocurrency to money transfer, database technology*

By using these technologies to their advantage, they're able to collect more funding with less restrictions via crowdsourcing due to the SEC's recent change that allows people with average amounts of money to participate in opportunities like this. They're considered a FinTech company because they built a platform that is challenging the traditional structure of investments and how start-ups can get funding.

### Republic's Strengths and Weaknesses

Republic has the ability to revolutionize how start-ups get their funds. It allows for more than just the super wealthy people to make investments into early ideas. They have the potential of changing the game forever regarding investments and funding - potentially putting investment banking out of business. They are exemplary because they've gotten rid of minimum investing requirements for start-ups in the FinTech space. 

They use the currency coin to raise money in small investments. A potential weakness could be the storage or security of the application - how are they securing the funds? Do people have guaranteed returns on these kinds of crowdsourced investments? 

### The Future of Republic 

They can improve regulation and security in the future. This company make it easier for people to invest their money, they can invest in crypto, which might not automatically be generated with a fund.
